# chatroom

# Learning Objectives
After this learning challenge, you'll be able to:

* Set up a node environment
* Make a connection between different clients and the servers
* Work with sockets
* Configure express and socket.io for node
* Make a basic chatroom

# Must-have features
* Make a UI that makes it easy for people to send messages in this chatroom.
* It must be possible to send a message to everyone or to yourself
* Make sure we can identify who sent the message through a username.
    *We could make a local variable and prompt the user to choose a username
    * We can then emit this username along with the sent message to keep track of who sent what.
* Make a list to show everyone who is connected to the chatroom
* Implement something funny! The sky is the limit! (it can be very simple if you want)
    * For example, you could make a functionality to make someone else's font size obscurely small!
    * You could implement a feature where you can speak with someone else's username
* AND SO MUCH MORE -> BE CREATIVE
